                Historically, a quilombo was a refuge in Brazil, offering
                shelter and safety. From this meaning, the owners decided to
                name their coffee shop after this. Cafetal Quilombo Caf√© is
                meant to be a community open to everyone, a place to relax, be
                present, and enjoy some great coffee.
